The following demonstrates where I'm at with the INTERCAL version of the 
guessing game. Formatting is the best it can be, at it looks like 
I need to write a File I/O library to save the highscore list. 
(This has required writing boolean subroutines for numerical tests).

As is the norm with INTERCAL, the input is in words (SEVEN FIVE = 75) and
the output is in roman numerals (IV = 4).

C-INTERCAL demo:

   ~/intercal-0.22/pit> ../ick guess.i
   ~/intercal-0.22/pit> ./guess
   guess.i - Guess a number between 1 and 100
   
   Guess number, 
   I
   Enter guess,
   FIVE OH
   
   Higher...
   
   Guess number,  
   II
   Enter guess,
   SEVEN FIVE
   
   Higher...
   
   Guess number,   
   III
   Enter guess,
   EIGHT NINER
   
   Lower...
   
   Guess number,  
   IV
   Enter guess,
   EIGHT TWO
   
   Higher...
   
   Guess number, 
   V
   Enter guess,
   EIGHT FIVE
   
   Correct! that took, 
   V
   guesses.



J-INTERCAL demo:

   ~/intercal-java/samples> jick guess.i
   ~/intercal-java/samples> java guess
   guess.i - Guess a number between 1 and 100
   
   Guess number, 
   I
   Enter guess,
   FIVE OH
   
   Lower...
   
   Guess number,  
   II
   Enter guess,
   TWO OH
   
   Lower...
   
   Guess number,   
   III
   Enter guess,
   ONE OH
   
   Correct! that took,   
   III
   guesses.
